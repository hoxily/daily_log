kinect for windows sdk v2.0 不支持windows 7.
为了加快调试真人试衣，最好还是升级系统比较好。

1. 貌似现在还是不能同时穿上两件衣服。找一下原因。


Install Instructions

    To install the Kinect for Windows SDK 2.0:
        Make sure the Kinect sensor is not plugged into any of the USB ports on the computer.
        From the download location, double-click on KinectSDK-v2.0_1409-Setup.exe
        Once the Kinect for Windows SDK has completed installing successfully, ensure the Kinect sensor is connected to the power hub and the power hub is plugged into an outlet. Plug the USB cable from the power hub into a USB 3.0 port on your computer. Driver installation will begin automatically.
        Wait for driver installation to complete. You can verify that installation has completed by launching Device Manager and verifying that "KinectSensor Device" exists in the device list. Note:On first plugin, the firmware on the device will be updated. This may result in the device enumeration happening several times in the first minute.
        Installation is now complete. 


。。。总算装好windows10了。
找到只能穿一件衣物的原因了。CheckSexViolation返回的boolean值写反了。坑。
